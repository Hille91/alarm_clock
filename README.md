# alarm_clock
Hello,

my name is Tobias. I tried to build an easy alarm clock for my first project. 

My problem is that the programm works only in debugg mode. Not in debugg mode i get the warning below when i set an alarm at current time or when its alarm time for a saved alarm. Without playing the alarm sound then python closes after that.

The programm worked well before today. Today i made only a few updates of the interface and now a have this warning.

Maybe some one can help me out here. I would be happy about some gerneral advices about my coding as well.

My guess is that the problem has something to do with the background thread but im not sure because it worked fine before.

Ty and a Happy New Year.
